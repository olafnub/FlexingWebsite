            <p>Iced Coffee Hour has always been a podcast I liked, first video that caught my eye. Graham Stephen likes clickbaiting his video 
                with a sad expresison. Overtime - it gets boring and exaggerated and you just feel down everytime you see his thumbnails. But it
                does its job of getting views; when he did try to change. His happy thumbnails had significally lower views than his rest. <br> If you were
                to read the comments, it's always a cycle of people getting upset that Graham clickbaits with his sad expressions.
                <ul>
                <li>Graham has sad thumbanils -> People Complaning and wanting happier thumbnails</li>
                <li>Graham changes to happy thumbnails -> Views decrease by a huge percentage</li>
                <li>Graham goes back to sad thumbanils -> Views increase by a significance</li>
                </ul>
