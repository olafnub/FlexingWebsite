            <p><strong>Geo-Wiki </strong>The Geo Wiki is about Robert, quick summary of him and who he is. I didn't really read it. I read a bit of it
            and honestly the amazing game he made with the help and inspiration of others took only 4 months. Geometry-Dash is such a good game, the music was 
            amazing also.</p>
