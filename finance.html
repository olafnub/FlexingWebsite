        <h3>Roth IRA - a Wealth Creator for all generations</h3>
        <p>Roth Ira is more preferred by most youngers, because it's an account that is used more advantageously at a younger age / know you'll make more in the 
            future:<strong>OPINION</strong> A Roth Ira is a retirement account where you contribute your after tax money and let it grow tax free, even when retired</p>

        <p>A lot of HYSA are FDIC Insured - They would have higher interest than regular saving accounts. i.e, Chase gives a 0.01% compared to Ally, which 
            gives ~1% (A whole 0.99% Higher!)

    <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
    <p>Interest rates are pretty cool - the higher the better. Unless it's what you have to pay then the more the worse. Interest rates
        when it comes to investing can compound over time. This means money is working for you in an exponential line (or I meant growing). 
    </p>
    <p>Interest debt is different to investing debt because I think if debt interest was the same as investing interest, then it would not be too good
        for people with debts because everyone would be paying their entire lifetime for it. Or have a million dollar debt when they're supposed to retire.
